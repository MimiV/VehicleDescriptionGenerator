[Youtube video showing how the application works](https://youtu.be/vF2TIY74jAg)

This is solo project created to facilitate the life of a significant other who is an inventory manager at a dealership.

Dealership will individually upload pictures and comments for each vehicle on their website. The comment is the second most important aspect after pictures, it tells what comes in the vehicle with packages and options, as well as a dealership features and promotions. Dealership Inventory Managers spend a lot of times looking through vehicle options and packages through vin searches.

This program allows the inventory manager to complete the commenting section without having to continuously search each vehicle available options and packages between different websites. It reduces the time necessary to look through each vehicle VIN and locating options. It also automatically includes dealership messages used for every vehicle, serving as a template.
